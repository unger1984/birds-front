    "about.p1": "I have been feeding birds at my dacha for a couple of years now. I work from home, and my desk is right in front of the window, behind which hangs a feeder. Every morning I pour out a new batch of seeds, and then I watch the different birds flock to the feast.",
    "about.p2": "It turns out that the feathered world of central Russia is quite rich. Very often I had to use Google to determine what kind of bird came for lunch.",
    "about.p3": "Most often, of course, it is the common titmouse that flies in. This bird is very cautious. First, it sits on a branch of a nearby apple tree and looks around. Then it quickly flies up, grabs a seed, and returns to the branch, where it begins to peel it.",
    "about.p4": "Sparrows are also frequent guests. They are much more impudent. They always fly in a flock and eat sitting right in the feeder. The stronger and more impudent ones also drive away their comrades. It is funny to watch their confrontation.",
    "about.p5": "In winter, bullfinches often visit the feeder. It turns out that the female bullfinch's belly is not red at all, but simply gray. At first, I couldn't figure out for a long time what kind of strange bird it was, it looked like a bullfinch, but it wasn't red!",
    "about.p6": "The rarer guests I saw were robins, forest canaries, thrushes, and nightingales. I saw a hawfinch a couple of times. Last winter two partridges often came, they didn't sit on the feeder, they \"grazed\" in the snow underneath it.",
    "about.p7": "My house cat adds a special piquancy to the situation. She loves to hunt all kinds of animals. When she is at home, she sits next to the window and watches the birds with excitement. She even tries to \"twitter\". Then she asks to go outside, and then the birds have to be doubly careful. Despite the completely unmasking color and bell, the cat sometimes manages to catch some gaping bird.",
    "about.p8": "In general, an interesting and sometimes fascinating movie is unfolding under my window, with natural actors. So I thought, why am I the only one watching all this, I need to share this wonderful spectacle with the world. It's the age of high technology after all. I decided to set up a camera and organize this broadcast.",
    "about.p9": "Here you can watch the birds with me, discuss what you saw in the chat and throw in a small penny for bird food. The project is completely non-commercial, does not provide paid services. But I will not refuse donations that will go to feed the birds and develop the project. I have thoughts of installing a few more cameras, or even organizing a feeder in a more inaccessible place.",
    "about.p10": "I usually pour out food for the birds in the morning. Towards the end of autumn, in winter and at the beginning of spring I try to do it every day. Less often in summer – the birds have enough natural food, they become rare guests at the feeder and do not have time to eat everything. In winter, they eat the food quite quickly – after lunch the feeder is almost empty.",
    "about.p11": "I will be glad to receive any of your suggestions and comments. Leave comments in the broadcast chat, I will definitely read them!"
